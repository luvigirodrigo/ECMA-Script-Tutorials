/*
    1. Destructuring of both arrays as well as objects are really ujseful
       to quickly destructure a certain object or an array to get certain values

    2. In destructuring, we are NOT CHANGING THE ORIGINAL OBJECT or ARRAY

    3. When destructuring objects, we pull out the values by their property name

    4. When destructuring arrays, we pull out the values by their position
